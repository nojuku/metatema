Taras Shevchenko 1814-1861

Taras Shevchenko was born on March 9, 1814 in the village of Moryntsi, Zvenigorod district, Kyiv province, in a peasant family of slaves.

He spent his childhood years in the village of Kerelovka.

In the fall of 1822, he began to study literacy with a local church cantor.

Once he ended up as an orphan he asked for being a hireling to a church cantor named Bogorsky, who came from Kyiv.

Taras became a victim of bullying and cruelty of the cantor, so he ran away looking for a mentor-painter across the nearest villages.

In 1828 he was hired as a cossachyok (servant) at the lord's court in the village called Wilshan.

From the fall of 1828 until the beginning of 1831 - Shevchenko stayed with his master in Vilnius.

After moving from Vilnius to St. Petersburg in 1831, sir Engelhardt took Shevchenko with him and arranged him a 4 years mentorship by the painter Vasily Shiryaev.

In the summer of 1836, Taras met his countryman - the artist I. Soshenko, who linked Taras to Eugene Grebinka, V. Grigorovich, and O. Venetsianov.

In the spring of 1838, Karl Bryullov and Vasily Zhukovsky bought a young poet from serfdom. He soon became a student at the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.

The first collection of his poetic works was published in 1840 under the name Kobzar. On May 25, 1843, he left St. Petersburg and went to Ukraine.

In February 1844 he left Ukraine and went to St. Petersburg through Moscow. In 1844 he wrote a poignant political poem "Dream" ("Each Person's Destiny's His Own"), embarking on a path of uncompromising struggle against the autocratic system of the Russian Empire.

On April 5, the Council of the Academy of Arts issued a ticket for travel to Ukraine. As early as November 1845, a meeting of the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg approved the council's decision to grant the title of non-class artist.

On March 31 (April 12), 1845 he left St. Petersburg via Moscow to Kyiv. In the spring of 1846, he arrived in Kyiv, settled in the house.

In April he joined the Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood; he was arrested on April 5, 1847, sent to St. Petersburg and imprisoned in a casemate. Then he was sent to the soldiers in Orenburg.

Some relief of Shevchenko's position came in the spring of 1848 as a result of his participation in the Aral expedition.

In April 1850 Shevchenko was arrested for the second time and, after six months in prison, was then sent to one of the worst penal settlements, the remote fortress of Novopetrovsk at Mangyshlak Peninsula

He was released in 1857.

In the spring of 1858, the poet arrived to St. Petersburg.

In the summer of 1859, he returned to Ukraine, which he had not seen for 12 years.

Until the last days of his life, the poet was under police surveillance.

March 10, 1861 - Shevchenko died.

He had done many literary works as well as paintings. Here some of his works are represented. Specifically, those that do not fully match the stable image of Taras forced in media and institutions for recent centuries.

Drawing on the same plot Shevchenko finished much later, as he [wrote in a letter](https://www.t-shevchenko.name/uk/Corresp/1857/1857-05-08.html#Line7) to Br. Zaleski on May 10, 1857:

"Of the pieces sent to you one may seem to you to be incomprehensible. This is the legend of the origin of the painting. Daughter of Chios potter painted on the hut doors silhouette of her lover, and she was the first woman-painter".
