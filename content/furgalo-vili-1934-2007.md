FURGALO Vili 1934-2007

Born March 22, 1934 in Gorlovka, Donetsk region. His father was a supporter of communist ideology. In 1939, Willie and his parents moved to Lviv. According to some reports, this real name is Vasily Popov, and Furgalo took his surname from his wife Irina. According to other sources, the real name is Furgala Wilhelm Vladimirovich.

During the German occupation, he lived in a shelter in Przemysl, from where he sometimes fled. He returned to Lviv in 1944, once the occupation of the USSR had began. He was homeless, living in a ruined little house on Copernicus Street.

At the age of 38, he took a great interest in photography, went to the Semaphore Photography Lovers Club in Lviv that was being managed by Vladimir Shcherbovich. In 1970s Vili became the most famous Lviv "out-of-sytem" (underground) photographer. Furgalo's works were exhibited in Lviv and abroad, mainly in the Baltic States, where he received awards and certificates. In the photo club, Vili meets Roman Baran, a famous photographer throughout the USSR.

The main subjects observed in Furgalo's work are children, women, hippies, and representatives of the city's creative underground. Most of the photos were taken in Lviv from 1974 to 2001. For some time he worked as a photographer for the Local History Museum. According to his contemporaries, Willy had perfect photography techniques and had made photographs of exceptional quality and technique.

While working for the Historical Museum, Vili got suspected of committing a theft of equipment after which he resigned and worked as a loader for a while at the Red Hat Cafe on Liberty Avenue. Once he quit this job, Vili devoted himself entirely to photography, including working in a utility room, in a small workshop near the puppet theater where his wife worked.

In the 1990s, Vili took photographs of young Svyatoslav Vakarchuk and the first crew of Okean Elzy band, which included Pavel Gudimov, Yuri Khustochka, and Denis Glinin.

In 1999, on the historic walls at the end of Armenian Street between Dziga and the square in front of the Dominican Church, Vili exhibited hundreds of his own works.
