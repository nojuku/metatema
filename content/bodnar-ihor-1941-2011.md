“.. Since the first touch of a pencil to the paper, the eternal life of the line begins. Here I am writing these words and this is the life of the line. When I am drawing there is also a wonderful mystery is being created by the line. Each line seems to have a soul, it has a birth, lives, breathes and it never dies. Because it is eternal as life itself. ” (I. Bodnar // Notebook, 1960s)

1. In the darkness, the eye has a better spiritual vision ..

2. How to go through life? - just like walking down the string above the abyss: beautifully, frugally and fast..

3. Half of human life is spent communicating with the astral world, but one does not remember it

4. Everyone sees the astral cliche through the color of their aura

5. Cosmos is reflected in the pupil of each eye

(I. Bodnar // Notebook. Early 1970s)

“It sometimes seems to me that the time in which I live now is not really my time, that someone is conducting some experiment on me, testing the state of my soul, in the conditions of earthly life.

Only sometimes in dreams do I see episodic snippets that seem to be a broadcast from some cliché of my future.

Probably everything that in earthly life is called fantasy, in other worlds and dimensions is a reality created by the almighty Mind - God.

The universe is limitless. The transformation of the soul into other unknown worlds is prayer, and there, in the unknown world, different metamorphoses: reincarnations into other unknown beings”.

_I will leave for the memory_

_To you your horse,_

_What's in my picture_

_Calmly into the world of contemplation._

_Look closely_

_To this picture in the evening_

_In the eyes of a horse._

_(Ihor Bodnar, early 2000s)_
