Julian Dorosh was born on 9 June 1909 in the family of an Austrian officer in Zhidachiv. Shortly, his father was transferred to Ternopil region, where Julian had spent his childhood (town of Kopychyntsi). In the early 1920s, Dorosh’s family settled in Stanislav, where Julian graduated from Ukrainian high school. There he joined Plast organization, where he picked up a camera for the first time.

During the period of 1927-1932, Julian studied at the Law Faculty of Lviv University. The life path of Julian Dorosh was very much connected with Vinnyky (a town in Lviv region). He lived in the family of his uncle Anton Krushelnytsky who was a writer and teacher.

Julian Dorosh was studying at the Law Faculty of Lviv University at that time. Meanwhile, Anton Krushelnytsky published the New Paths magazine, which was featuring mainly Ukrainian poets, avant-garde artists, critics and architects. This period had a significant impact on Dorosh's worldview as well as on the future of his creative path. This period of time happened to be a beginning to his cooperation with many Lviv Ukrainian publications (e.g."Days", "Life and Knowledge", "Cinema", "Light and Shadow", "Ukrainian News") on a regular basis.

After the departure of the Krushelnytsky family to Soviet Ukraine, Dorosh had problems with housing and employment. His friends offered him a job of a photographer and translator at the scientific "Society of the Hutsulschyna Supporters" from Warsaw, that every year collected ethnographic material in the Carpathians (particularly the materials collected while working at the Society that formed the basis of the exhibition "Our Motherland in the Light" (1935) were featured, organized by the Ukrainian Photographic Society in Lviv).

During World War II, Jaroslav Pasternak (familiar with Dorosh since the time of his joint work at UVOTO) conducted archaeological excavations in Halych (Krylos), where Julian Dorosh was personally invited to work as a photographer.

In 1939 Y. Dorosh, together with O. Dovzhenko and V. Sofroniv-Levitsky, traveled to the Carpathians (Kosiv, Kuta, Kryvorivnya).

The years of the war were not very productive for Julian, he barely made few family photos.

From 1946 a new period in the master’s life had started, which is remarkable by many creative achievements. In 1956 - 1965 Dorosh had become a photographer of the Archeology Department in the Institute of Social Sciences. He was a participant of the Institute's archeological expeditions. Julian’s photographs were published in works on archeology, ethnography, folk art, and were exhibited in three personal exhibitions.

Julian was also a photographer at the Lviv History Museum, worked at the Department of History of Engineering at the Lviv Polytechnic Institute, and was one of the first masters of the color photography technique in Lviv.

In 1956, at the suggestion of I. Krypiakevich at the Department of Archeology of the Institute of Social Sciences of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, J. Dorosh organized a photo lab in which illustrations for guides, albums, books ("Historical Passages in Lviv", etc.) were printed.
