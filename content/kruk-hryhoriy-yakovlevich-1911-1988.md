(30. 10. 1911, Bratyshev village, now Tlumatz district of Ivano-Frankivsk region - 05. 12. 1988, Munich) - sculptor, graphic artist.

From 1945 - in Munich, where he taught at the Academy of Sciences. In his work he was developing monumental and small-format sculptures in bronze, plaster, terracotta.

The main subjects were nostalgia for their native land, spiritual and physical images of Carpathian peasants, historical past of Ukraine, compositions of the curvy female figures, and portraits.

He did not idealize the strict and simple figures of the characters, not seeking the beauty of them but only the authenticity and the characters of the features.

Since he was depicting the world of peasants’ physical labor and poverty itselg, his figures would sometimes come out as extremely rough.

Kruk was transmitting natural movement of human body avoiding superficial poetic gestures.

The majority of pieces were created in expressionist and dynamic style lacking details.

Kruk invented a special kind of carving, where the essential components were simplified generalized masses, reduced to holistic luster.

The fulness of the volume is caused by the static and seclusion of the material.
